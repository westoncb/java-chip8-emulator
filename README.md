# java-chip8-emulator

This is a chip8/schip emulator written in Java with LWJGL rendering. Feel free to use it for anything you'd like. I wrote this when attempting to learn emulator programming when I was a teenager back in 2005 or so, and I no longer have any familiarity with the code baseâ€”just thought I'd put it out there rather than let it rot/disappear completely.

The two features of note are 1) an interesting visual style 2) a neat (IMO) hack to improve flicker from XOR rendering in the original machine.
